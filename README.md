**Yelp Code** is a yelp based app using the [The Yelp Database API](http://docs.yelp.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] a task list item
- [x] list syntax required
- [x] normal **formatting**, @mentions, #1234 refs
- [ ] incomplete
- [x] completed

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Infinite scroll
- [ ] Map view

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. I liked the aspect of getting the API key and using the network to upload information to the application.
2. I enjoyed only making a single table view cell and several other copies were created through code.
